The following is\\na list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this\\nafternoon's meeting:\\n\\n1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We\\nwill need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,\\nCPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know\\nall of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do\\nthey know that for example, PID \\\"123\\\" maps back to Product \\\"ABC\\\"?  I would\\nthink the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to\\nspecific product information on your system.\\n\\n2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from\\n\\\"Required\\\" to \\\"Implied\\\" during the last version of the DTD that we received\\nfrom you?\\n\\n3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:\\nThere are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is\\npassed between systems.\\nThe following is a list of those specified in the External Interface\\nDocument:\\n\\nPost Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nRequest Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nAttempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nPost Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nPost Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\n\\nShould all of the parameter names be \\\"xml\\\" or should the parameter names for\\nPost Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the\\nnaming convention of the other use cases?\\n\\nUsing \\\"xml\\\" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the\\nredundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal\\ninterfaces.\\n\\n4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on\\nour system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss\\nalternatives for dealing with date interpretation.\\n\\n5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent\\nback within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that\\nconfirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no\\ninterface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this\\nassumption in this meeting.\\n\\n6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt\\nif for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a\\ntransaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?\\n\\n7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as\\nopposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is\\na generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting\\nfiles.\\n\\nThanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you\\nlater today!\\n\\nRegards,\\nMaria\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: David.Fisher@enron.com [mailto:David.Fisher@enron.com]\\nSent: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 8:30 AM\\nTo: Maria.O'neill@Enform.com\\nSubject: RE: Enron-TrueQuote Integration Technical Questions\\n\\n\\n\\nMaria,\\n\\nI understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product\\nmapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or\\nMike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.\\nJay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.

The True Quote system needs to design\\nfunctionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.\\n\\nWhat is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction\\nattempt?\\n\\nEnron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold\\nfor waiting.\\n\\nWhat is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?\\n\\nThe EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on\\nMonday, October 2, 2000.\\n\\nExhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):\\n\\nConcerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently\\nhandles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing\\npotentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given\\nthis level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be\\naccomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:\\n\\nWhat is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that\\nwill be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these\\nproducts will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per\\nsecond?\\n\\nAlthough it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it\\nwas clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time\\nintervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled\\n(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)\\nNeed to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL\\nwill send them automatically at certain time intervals.\\n\\nWill there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product\\nupdate, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple\\nEnron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote\\nneed to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive\\none XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron\\nproducts?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how\\noften will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron\\nproduct, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document\\nsubmissions per second?\\n\\nThe XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one\\nProduct ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one\\nProduct ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.\\n\\nCan we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per\\nEnron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity\\nofferings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.\\n\\nEnron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL\\nis exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product\\nID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the\\nOffer.\\n\\nThe interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the\\norder.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a\\nproduct price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be\\nloaded with a duration of \\\"Good Until Canceled\\\".  True Quote will mark the\\norder as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product\\nthat changes the status to \\\"Suspended\\\".  In this case True Quote would\\ncancel the order on the True Quote system.\\n\\nAll orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull\\nthe deals.  At this time, EOL would send \\\"Suspended Status\\\" for the Product\\nID.\\n\\nHow are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron\\ncommodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new\\nproduct id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to\\nNovember?\\n Yes\\n\\nIf product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable\\nterm, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote\\nplatform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is\\nassociated with?\\nProduct IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term\\n\\nWe are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a\\nproduct offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and\\ntradable term.\\nThis assumption is correct\\n\\nCan we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform\\nwill be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be\\nre-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will\\nthe assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active\\nuntil the status has been changed to \\\"Suspended\\\"?\\n\\nAll EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For\\nthose that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that\\nremoves all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will\\nauthenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be\\ntransmitted to True Quote.\\n\\nExhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):\\n\\nFor each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data\\ntypes (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nCan we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a\\ncharacter, what is the character indicator?  B/A?\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nCan we confirm the data type for volume is integer?\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nAcross all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and\\nvolume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of\\nmeasure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product\\nids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for\\nnatural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?\\n\\nCurrency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not\\nan attribute\\n\\nPrice - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nVolume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value\\nestablished for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For\\nexample, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is\\n5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume\\nincrements, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).\\n\\nOn EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the\\nminimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nHow to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only\\ndisplay the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader\\nhas a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we\\ndisplay this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)\\n\\n\\nCan we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id\\nis a \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to\\nEnron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If\\nthe deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed\\nfrom Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made\\nthe order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to\\nnon-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True\\nQuote system.\\n\\nAlready answered above.\\n\\nWill Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron\\nprice interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote\\nsubmit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron\\noffer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a\\ntransaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?\\n\\nEnron will allow partial fills.\\n\\nExhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):\\nDoes Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an\\nEnron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available\\nfor that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?\\nThis would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True\\nQuote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep\\nmultiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to\\nsatisfy transaction attempt.\\nAlternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best\\nindividual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from\\nonly one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote\\nwould not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML\\ninterface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules\\nmaintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).\\nAlternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price\\nofferings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume\\nofferings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point\\nshould be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True\\nQuote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit\\nindividual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate\\nvolume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and\\nchoose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer\\nservice agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological\\nsequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.\\n\\nEnron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.\\nEnron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron\\nProduct ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for\\n100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of\\n10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nFair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of\\norders without bias)\\nNeed to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface\\ntransactions and Enron Trader transactions\\nNeed to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in\\nthe market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given\\nProduct ID's market depth.\\n\\nOur concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and\\ntheir associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),\\ngiving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could\\npotentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require\\ndeals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request\\nwas received by the True Quote platform.\\n\\n\\nExhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):\\nAre we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against\\nTrue Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the\\nduration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" or\\nsome other duration?\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nThe traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without\\nadjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will\\nbe to be discussed.\\n\\nExhibit E (Counterparty Interface):\\nIn general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of\\ntheir daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day\\ncounterparty credit/term interface:\\nCurrently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an\\nXML DTD.\\nWhat are the \\\"terms\\\" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For\\nexample, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial\\nlimits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)\\nby Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,\\ndeal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /\\nno' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the\\nEnron product id?\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nCredit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the\\nteleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better\\nunderstand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling\\nEnron's credit structure.\\n\\n\\nQuestions for True Quote to Answer:\\n\\nExhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing\\ntransactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction\\nInterface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders\\nproposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of\\ntransaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have\\nto invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply\\nconfirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it\\nsucceeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the\\ndeal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.\\nWhat is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction\\nattempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should\\nalert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to\\nreturn either a confirmation or failure.\\n\\nPlease respond to the questions above.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nTo: \\\"O'Neill, Maria\\\"\\nCc: \\\"Glass, Brett\\\"\\nSubject: Teleconference Highlights\\nDate: Fri, 6 Oct 2000 12:21:11 -0600\\nMessage-ID: <F150C1D2E6C3374AA8A7A1A9B93E91BB30DF3D@mailbert.enform.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\\\"iso-8859-1\\\"\\nX-Priority: 3 (Normal)\\nX-MSMail-Priority: Normal\\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook CWS, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0)\\nImportance: Normal\\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2919.6700\\n\\n* Product ID\\n* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -\\nIncludes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty\\n* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are\\ntokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for\\ndesignated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).

I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...\\nperhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's\\nbest business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always\\nfill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.\\nHowever, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the\\nentire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume\\nwith the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,\\nwe would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new\\ntransaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep\\nfor the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.\\n\\nI haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if\\nEOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably\\nbe no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL\\ndenies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the\\nEOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available\\ncounterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled\\nus, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the\\nfull volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume\\nthey confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different\\ncounterparty.

I will\\nreiterate his statements through the following examples:\\n\\nIf Enron posts a gas product with 50,000 MMBTU available and TrueQuote\\nattempts a transaction on 30,000 MMBTU, the attempt will be successfull if\\nthe following 3 criteria are met:\\n\\n1.  30,000 MMBTU is still available when the transaction hits EOL.\\n2.  30,000 MMBTU meets the minimum volume for the product as set by the\\ntrader.\\n3.  30,000 MMBTU meets the increment volume for the product as set by the\\ntrader.\\n\\nExamples of how the 3 criteria above come into play:\\n\\n1.  If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume\\navailable for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will\\nfail.\\n2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader\\nhas set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction\\nwill fail.\\n3.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 32,500 MMBTU but the EOL trader\\nhas set 5,000 MMBTU increments, the transaction will fail.\\n\\nI set-up a meeting with Jay Webb and Andy Zipper for next Friday.  That is\\nthe earliest we all could meet.  Once we talk, I'll coordinate a conference\\ncall with you.

The conference call\\nwill Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.\\n14).

He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a\\n\\\"day 2\\\" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th\\ndeliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the\\nfunctionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will\\nallow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another\\npriority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are\\ngoing to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and\\nneed to be in production by January 5th.\\n\\nTrue Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction\\nattempts\\nfrom EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that\\nneeds to be met by January 5th.\\n\\nPlease let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not\\nbe ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests\\n(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is\\nany concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please\\nlet me know this as soon as possible, as well.

I'll talk to Maria first thing in the\\nmorning...\\nperhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's\\nbest business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always\\nfill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.\\nHowever, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the\\nentire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume\\nwith the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled\\nus,\\nwe would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a\\nnew\\ntransaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep\\nfor the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.\\n\\nI haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if\\nEOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably\\nbe no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL\\ndenies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the\\nEOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next\\navailable\\ncounterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially\\nfilled\\nus, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for\\nthe\\nfull volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume\\nthey confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different\\ncounterparty.

The following is\\na list of technical questions that we would like to discuss in this\\nafternoon's meeting:\\n\\n1) This one is probably going to be discussed in the first two hours - We\\nwill need to have the data to populate our tables with in order to map PID,\\nCPID, RID, PSETID, CATGID, CTYID, CMDTYID.  The non-technical people know\\nall of the information about the products, deal types, etc.  However, do\\nthey know that for example, PID \\\"123\\\" maps back to Product \\\"ABC\\\"?  I would\\nthink the technical people are the ones that know how this codes map back to\\nspecific product information on your system.\\n\\n2) Could you provide us a little background on why Credit term changed from\\n\\\"Required\\\" to \\\"Implied\\\" during the last version of the DTD that we received\\nfrom you?\\n\\n3) We sent this question a few days ago, but have not received a response:\\nThere are several different parameter names specified for the XML that is\\npassed between systems.\\nThe following is a list of those specified in the External Interface\\nDocument:\\n\\nPost Prices:  prices (Page 12, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nRequest Prices:  prices (Page 14, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nAttempt Transaction: txn (Page 16, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nPost Product Set Data: xml (Page 26, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\nPost Credit Matrix: xml (Page 28, Notes, Decision 1, Parameters)\\n\\nShould all of the parameter names be \\\"xml\\\" or should the parameter names for\\nPost Product Set Data and Post Credit Matrix be changed to reflect the\\nnaming convention of the other use cases?\\n\\nUsing \\\"xml\\\" as the parameter name for all use cases will reduce the\\nredundancy of the code we'll need to write to route the data to our internal\\ninterfaces.\\n\\n4) We still have some concerns over having to maintain Enron's calendar on\\nour system since term is sent as part of the key.  We would like to discuss\\nalternatives for dealing with date interpretation.\\n\\n5) We had asked a question earlier regarding business responses being sent\\nback within the same HTTP session.   We are going to assume that\\nconfirmation comes back in the HTTP response since there has been no\\ninterface defined for business responses.  We would like to confirm this\\nassumption in this meeting.\\n\\n6) Is there going to be some capability of cancelling a transaction attempt\\nif for some reason we do not receive a response back from Enron on a\\ntransaction attempt and a subsequent transaction search?\\n\\n7) Would Enron consider posting all of their requests to a .asp file as\\nopposed to a file with no extension (ext_nrt.asp instead of ext_nrt)?  It is\\na generally accepted practice to include file extensions when transporting\\nfiles.\\n\\nThanks again for everything David.  We will look forward to talking to you\\nlater today!\\n\\nRegards,\\nMaria\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: David.Fisher@enron.com [mailto:David.Fisher@enron.com]\\nSent: Wednesday, November 08, 2000 8:30 AM\\nTo: Maria.O'neill@Enform.com\\nSubject: RE: Enron-TrueQuote Integration Technical Questions\\n\\n\\n\\nMaria,\\n\\nI understand your concern and while I want to ensure we address product\\nmapping as the primary focus of the meetings, I asked if Jay Webb and/or\\nMike Guadarrama could spend some time discussing your technical questions.\\nJay and/or Mike will be available from 3-4 today to do just this.

We have inserted Enron's answers in Blue and have\\nhighlighted follow-ups and offline discussions in Red.\\n\\n\\nQuestions for Enron to answer regarding True Quote's interface:\\n\\nHigh Priority Questions (need to be addressed):\\n(From Exhibit A) Will the product ID that Enron is transmitting specifically\\nidentify a product offering including commodity, deal type, region /\\nlocation, and tradable term (fully qualified begin and end dates)?\\n\\nProduct ID is a fully transactable item - Product, Location, Dates\\nProduct ID is a fully qualified instrument - excluding price, volume and\\ncounterparty\\nProduct ID can be for next day and balance of month.  However, on next to\\nlast day of month, the Product ID will offer either next day or BOM, not\\nboth (there is no reason for redundancy)\\nProduct ID that is for anything, except for the rolling Tokenized\\nproducts/dates (example: For a spot month, the Product ID will expire on the\\nfirst day of that spot month)\\nCurrency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not\\nan attribute\\n\\n\\n(From Exhibit B) Can we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an\\nEnron product id is a \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" transaction, meaning, a transaction\\nattempt submitted to Enron would not stay in their system if it was not\\nimmediately filled.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will\\nbe immediately removed from Enron's system and could not be filled later if\\nmarket conditions made the order viable.\\n\\nA transaction attempt by TrueQuote will be \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" (It will not in\\nstay in EOL's system)\\n\\nIf the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to non-availability of volume,\\nthese volumes need to be expired in the True Quote system\\n\\nIf a transaction attempt fails for ANY reason, Enron will immediately\\nrebroadcast that Product to the True Quote system\\n\\nDoes True Quote need to design functionality for partial fill of a deal\\ntransaction for an outside entity?\\n\\nEnron will do partial fills.  The True Quote system needs to design\\nfunctionality to accept partial fills from an outside entity.\\n\\nWhat is the time threshold for waiting on an Enron response to a transaction\\nattempt?\\n\\nEnron will accept whatever True Quote determines is an acceptable threshold\\nfor waiting.\\n\\nWhat is the estimated delivery date for Enron's DTDs?\\n\\nThe EnronOnline Exchanges External Interface Document was received on\\nMonday, October 2, 2000.\\n\\nExhibit A (Enron Price Interface-what Enron sends to TQ):\\n\\nConcerning the Enron price interface, Enron has stated that EOL currently\\nhandles prices/volume updates at the rate of 100 updates per second, growing\\npotentially to 500 per second (across all EOL product offerings).  Given\\nthis level of update activity, how will the transmission of these updates be\\naccomplished?  Below are some questions which should clarify these concerns:\\n\\nWhat is the expected rate of updates for the sub-set of EOL products that\\nwill be transmitted to the True Quote platform?  Is it expected that these\\nproducts will also endure update activity at the rate of 100-500 updates per\\nsecond?\\n\\nAlthough it was not communicated how often an XML document will be sent, it\\nwas clarified that the XML documents will be sent at certain time\\nintervals.Each update will contain all information since last time polled\\n(includes all changes (only changes) since last transmission)\\nNeed to clarify if True Quote will be polling EOL for Updates, or if EOL\\nwill send them automatically at certain time intervals.\\n\\nWill there be one XML document interface transmission for each Enron product\\nupdate, or will one XML document interface contain updates for multiple\\nEnron products?  The implications of this are as follows:  Will True Quote\\nneed to handle 100-500 XML documents per second, or will True Quote receive\\none XML document at a determined interval that has updates for all Enron\\nproducts?  If the XML document contains updates for all Enron products, how\\noften will Enron send us the document?   If it's one XML document per Enron\\nproduct, will True Quote be expected to handle 100-500 XML document\\nsubmissions per second?\\n\\nThe XML document will contain updates for multiple Product IDs.  If only one\\nProduct ID has changed in EOL since the last transmission, then only one\\nProduct ID will be sent to True Quote in the updates.\\n\\nCan we confirm that Enron will only submit one price/volume offering per\\nEnron product id; meaning, Enron will never have multiple price and quantity\\nofferings for the same Enron product ID on the True Quote platform.\\n\\nEnron will never send Market Depth for any Product ID.  What you see on EOL\\nis exactly what is transmitted to True Quote (one offering per Enron Product\\nID).  However, each Product ID update will contain both the Bid and the\\nOffer.\\n\\nThe interface currently does not have a field to define the duration of the\\norder.  Given this, can we assume that when the price interface submits a\\nproduct price/volume update to the True Quote platform, the order will be\\nloaded with a duration of \\\"Good Until Canceled\\\".  True Quote will mark the\\norder as 'GTC' until Enron submits a new XML document for that Enron product\\nthat changes the status to \\\"Suspended\\\".  In this case True Quote would\\ncancel the order on the True Quote system.\\n\\nAll orders will remain on the True Quote system until the EOL traders pull\\nthe deals.  At this time, EOL would send \\\"Suspended Status\\\" for the Product\\nID.\\n\\nHow are terms related to Enron Product IDs?  Example:  For a given Enron\\ncommodity, deal type, and location that is traded in October, would a new\\nproduct id be created for that same product offering when the month rolls to\\nNovember?\\n Yes\\n\\nIf product ids do not include a direct relationship to a specific tradable\\nterm, when a Price Interface XML document is submitted to the True Quote\\nplatform, how will True Quote know which trade term the product id is\\nassociated with?\\nProduct IDs do have a direct relationship to a specific tradable term\\n\\nWe are currently assuming that an Enron product id specifically identifies a\\nproduct offering including commodity, deal type, region/location, and\\ntradable term.\\nThis assumption is correct\\n\\nCan we confirm that all Enron orders transmitted to the True Quote platform\\nwill be cancelled at the end of the day and that all products will be\\nre-loaded into the True Quote system the following morning?  If not,  will\\nthe assumed 'Good Until Canceled' duration for each product id remain active\\nuntil the status has been changed to \\\"Suspended\\\"?\\n\\nAll EOL orders should be removed by the traders at the end of the day.  For\\nthose that are not removed, True Quote should run a nightly batch job that\\nremoves all EOL orders left in the system.  Each morning, True Quote will\\nauthenticate with EOL, and at this time, all orders on EOL will be\\ntransmitted to True Quote.\\n\\nExhibit B (Transaction Interface with Enron):\\n\\nFor each field (across all interfaces), we will need clearly defined data\\ntypes (precision, range of length, space/bytes it takes).\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nCan we assume the Bid/Ask flag is an integer? Perhaps a bit?  If it's a\\ncharacter, what is the character indicator?  B/A?\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nCan we confirm the data type for volume is integer?\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nAcross all interfaces, there is not a defined unit of measure for price and\\nvolume by Enron product id.   Should part of the XML DTD specify the unit of\\nmeasure for both price and volume, or are we to assume that Enron product\\nids for Power are in US dollars and megawatt/hr, and Enron product ids for\\nnatural gas are US dollars and MMBTU?\\n\\nCurrency and Unit of measure is implied as part of Product ID, but it is not\\nan attribute\\n\\nPrice - how many decimal places? (precision of the number)\\n\\nThis information still needs to be provided.\\n\\nVolume and Price - Does Enron have an min / max / default increment value\\nestablished for price and volume increment ranges by Enron product id?  (For\\nexample, within True Quote the default volume increment for natural gas is\\n5000, and the price increment is $0.0025.  Both the price and volume\\nincrements, min/max ranges can vary by region or location).\\n\\nOn EOL, the traders determine the minimal tradable increments and the\\nminimal tradable amounts (this minimums could be as low as 1).\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nHow to handle increments <> 5000 increment on the Enron side (will we only\\ndisplay the 5000 increment below the volume submitted by Enron, if trader\\nhas a minimum greater than entities are willing to participate, how do we\\ndisplay this and how does the minimum increment come across in the order)\\n\\n\\nCan we confirm a transaction attempt against Enron for an Enron product id\\nis a \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" transaction, meaning, a transaction attempt submitted to\\nEnron would not stay in their system if it was not immediately filled.  If\\nthe deal is not confirmed by Enron, the order will be immediately removed\\nfrom Enron's system and could not be filled later if market conditions made\\nthe order viable.  If the deal is not confirmed by Enron due to\\nnon-availability of volume, these volumes need to be expired in the True\\nQuote system.\\n\\nAlready answered above.\\n\\nWill Enron allow partial fill of transactions?   For example, if the Enron\\nprice interface submits an offer with 20,000 mmbtu available, can True Quote\\nsubmit a transaction bid attempt to take only 10,000 mmbtu of the Enron\\noffer?   If not, is it a valid assumption that we can only submit a\\ntransaction attempt to lift the entire Enron offer of 20,000 mmbtu?\\n\\nEnron will allow partial fills.\\n\\nExhibit C (True Quote Price Interface-what TQ sends to Enron):\\nDoes Enron expect True Quote to submit a single price point offering for an\\nEnron product id that is the aggregate total volume of all orders available\\nfor that product id on the True Quote platform at the best available price?\\nThis would allow Enron to submit a transaction attempt against the True\\nQuote platform, submitting a volume request that would potentially sweep\\nmultiple counter parties creating deals with all entities necessary to\\nsatisfy transaction attempt.\\nAlternative 2:  Does Enron expect True Quote to submit only the best\\nindividual order (the best price and volume for an Enron product id from\\nonly one counterparty) identified by its True Quote order id (True Quote\\nwould not transmit the counter party id; however, before sending the XML\\ninterface to Enron, the counterparty would have to pass the credit rules\\nmaintained in the counterparty credit matrix on the True Quote platform).\\nAlternative 3:  Would Enron expect True Quote to submit multiple price\\nofferings per Enron product id (a market depth of various price and volume\\nofferings).  In this scenario, the volume associated with each price point\\nshould be an aggregate of multiple True Quote orders (as shown in the True\\nQuote market screen).  The XML interface could potentially transmit\\nindividual True Quote orders and their associated volumes (not an aggregate\\nvolume of multiple orders); however, giving Enron the ability to 'pick and\\nchoose' individual orders could potentially violate True Quote customer\\nservice agreements that require deals to be executed in the chronological\\nsequence that the order request was received by the True Quote platform.\\n\\nEnron wants to see the granularity of each True Quote Product ID order.\\nEnron expects True Quote to submit multiple price offerings per Enron\\nProduct ID.  (Example:  If  True Quote has an order in the system for\\n100,000 MMbtu's at $3.00, which is comprised of 10 individual orders of\\n10,000, Enron wants True Quote to send all of the individual orders).\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nFair and equitable treatment with prices sent to Enron (proper processing of\\norders without bias)\\nNeed to discuss in more detail how to handle EOL price interface\\ntransactions and Enron Trader transactions\\nNeed to clarify with Enron whether they want to receive the best price in\\nthe market for a given Product ID, or if they want to see all of a given\\nProduct ID's market depth.\\n\\nOur concern is that if True Quote transmits individual True Quote orders and\\ntheir associated volumes (not an aggregate volume of multiple orders),\\ngiving Enron the ability to 'pick and choose' individual orders, this could\\npotentially violate True Quote customer service agreements that require\\ndeals to be executed in the chronological sequence that the order request\\nwas received by the True Quote platform.\\n\\n\\nExhibit D (Sponsor Transaction Interface):\\nAre we correct in assuming that transactions posted by Enron traders against\\nTrue Quote deals will be executed on the True Quote system?  Will the\\nduration of the order attempts being sent to True Quote be \\\"Fill or Kill\\\" or\\nsome other duration?\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nThe traders will want to transact against True Quote directly without\\nadjusting the market position through EOL, but how this is accomplished will\\nbe to be discussed.\\n\\nExhibit E (Counterparty Interface):\\nIn general, we need more details about what Enron will be sending as part of\\ntheir daily counterparty credit / term interface, as well as the intra-day\\ncounterparty credit/term interface:\\nCurrently, exhibit E does not specific any fields or data types within an\\nXML DTD.\\nWhat are the \\\"terms\\\" under which participants can trade with Enron?  For\\nexample, will the level of restriction include volumetric limits, financial\\nlimits, tradable date range limits (number days or months into the future)\\nby Enron product id (assuming a product id specifically defines a commodity,\\ndeal-type, region/location, and tradable term).  Will Enron send us a 'yes /\\nno' flag to turn off/on a counterparty's ability to trade with Enron by the\\nEnron product id?\\n\\nTo be worked Offline:\\nCredit terms and counterparty interface details were not addressed in the\\nteleconference.  The details of granularity will need to addressed to better\\nunderstand the responsibilities that True Quote will have in handling\\nEnron's credit structure.\\n\\n\\nQuestions for True Quote to Answer:\\n\\nExhibit D:  Does the Sponsor Transaction interface (Enron proposing\\ntransactions on the True Quote platform) still invoke the Enron Transaction\\nInterface?  There was some discussion that if internal Enron traders\\nproposed transactions against the True Quote platform, the point of\\ntransaction would be the True Quote platform, and True Quote would not have\\nto invoke the transaction on the EOL platform.  True Quote would simply\\nconfirm whether the Enron transaction attempt succeeded or failed.  If it\\nsucceeded, True Quote would send a confirmation XML interface to confirm the\\ndeal had been executed and transmit the True Quote Deal ID to Enron.\\nWhat is the time threshold for waiting on Enron's response to a transaction\\nattempt?  For example, after 'n' seconds the True Quote platform should\\nalert a system operator that an Enron transaction attempt has failed to\\nreturn either a confirmation or failure.\\n\\nPlease respond to the questions above.\\n\\nThank you.\\n\\n\\n\\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit\\nTo: \\\"O'Neill, Maria\\\"\\nCc: \\\"Glass, Brett\\\"\\nSubject: Teleconference Highlights\\nDate: Fri, 6 Oct 2000 12:21:11 -0600\\nMessage-ID: <F150C1D2E6C3374AA8A7A1A9B93E91BB30DF3D@mailbert.enform.com>\\nMIME-Version: 1.0\\nContent-Type: text/plain; charset=\\\"iso-8859-1\\\"\\nX-Priority: 3 (Normal)\\nX-MSMail-Priority: Normal\\nX-Mailer: Microsoft Outlook CWS, Build 9.0.2416 (9.0.2910.0)\\nImportance: Normal\\nX-MimeOLE: Produced By Microsoft MimeOLE V5.00.2919.6700\\n\\n* Product ID\\n* Product ID is a fully transactable item  and fully qualified instrument -\\nIncludes: Product, Location, Dates; Excludes: Price, Volume and Couterparty\\n* Tokenized Dates:  Product ID for next day and balance of month are\\ntokenized dates which means that the product ID will remain the same for\\ndesignated date range (next day, next 2 days, BOM, etc).

I'll talk to Maria first thing in the morning...\\nperhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's\\nbest business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always\\nfill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.\\nHowever, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the\\nentire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume\\nwith the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled us,\\nwe would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a new\\ntransaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep\\nfor the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.\\n\\nI haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if\\nEOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably\\nbe no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL\\ndenies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the\\nEOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next available\\ncounterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially filled\\nus, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for the\\nfull volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume\\nthey confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different\\ncounterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the\\nnext available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.\\nSeems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our\\ntransaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction\\nattempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will probably\\nend-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not\\navailable.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?\\n\\n-Stewart\\n\\nStewart D.

If when TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU, the volume\\navailable for the product drops to below 30,000 MMBTU, the transaction will\\nfail.\\n2.  If TrueQuote attempts to transact on 30,000 MMBTU but the EOL trader\\nhas set the minimum volume for the product to 40,000 MMBTU, the transaction\\nwill fail.\\n3.

We fully expect that Enron will send us (potentially) large\\nvolumes via. the price posting interface; then, we may execute multiple\\ntransaction attempts for that EOL product ID to Enron via. the transaction\\nattempt interface.  These individual transaction attempts could be much\\nsmaller (in volume) than the volume posted via. the price posting\\ninterface.\\n\\nBasically, the way we understand it is... the individual transaction\\nattempts will be 'all or nothing'; however, we can break the large price\\npost down and transmit multiple (smaller) transaction attempts against that\\nlarge price post volume.\\n\\nI believe we are all in agreement on this, but it never hurts to be\\nabsolutely sure concerning something of this magnitude and importance.\\n\\nThanks,\\n\\n-Stewart\\n\\n\\n-----Original Message-----\\nFrom: O'Neill, Maria [mailto:Maria.O'neill@Enform.com]\\nSent: Thursday, December 07, 2000 8:52 AM\\nTo: brett.glass@enform.com; stewart.clark@enform.com;\\nkimberly.hahn@enform.com; richard.stallings@enform.com\\nSubject: FW: One other item about Enron...\\n\\n\\nI've spoken the David Fisher at Enron this morning.  The conference call\\nwill Andy Zipper and Jay Webb cannot be arranged until next Thursday (Dec.\\n14). David will send details later.\\n\\nDavid has asked us to assume that there will be NO partial fills on either\\nside. He believes that even if they agree to do this it will likely be a\\n\\\"day 2\\\" enhancement and not a functionality that is part of the January 5th\\ndeliverables. He is also requesting that we focus on completing the\\nfunctionality that will allow Enron to post prices on True Quote and will\\nallow True Quote to execute transactions on EOL.  In addition, another\\npriority needs to be to have the credit functionality completed.  These are\\ngoing to be the requirements that need to be tested by December 18th and\\nneed to be in production by January 5th.\\n\\nTrue Quote's ability to send prices to Enron and accept transaction\\nattempts\\nfrom EOL is secondary at this point and not likely to be a requirement that\\nneeds to be met by January 5th.\\n\\nPlease let me know if there is any reason why the execution engine will not\\nbe ready to accept price posts from EOL and send transaction requests\\n(assuming only full orders will be filled) by December 18th.  If there is\\nany concern about getting credit functioning within that timeframe, please\\nlet me know this as soon as possible, as well.  Thanks for all of your\\nhelp.\\nYou all are key contributors to this project and without your awesome\\nknowledge and skills, we would never be able to complete this project in\\nthe\\ntimeframe that we're being asked to complete it in.

I'll talk to Maria first thing in the\\nmorning...\\nperhaps this one is already resolved?   I would think it would be in EOL's\\nbest business interest to store our minimum volumes, so EOL could always\\nfill us at least partially rather than deny the entire transaction.\\nHowever, it really doesn't matter to us (technically) we'll just cancel the\\nentire EOL transaction attempt and continue our sweep and fill the volume\\nwith the next available counterparty.   Whereas if they partially filled\\nus,\\nwe would probably cancel the original transaction attempt, and rebuild a\\nnew\\ntransaction deal ID for the 10,000 / day deal.... then continue the sweep\\nfor the final 5,000 from the next available counterparty.\\n\\nI haven't reviewed this scenario with the deal execution team yet, but if\\nEOL *did* partially fill us with *at least* our minimum, it would probably\\nbe no more or less complex for us because even in a scenario where EOL\\ndenies a transaction attempt, we ALREADY must have the logic to cancel the\\nEOL deal transaction attempt, and create a new order with the next\\navailable\\ncounterparty (to fill the volume request).   So, if EOL did partially\\nfilled\\nus, we would simply cancel the original transaction request that was for\\nthe\\nfull volume amount, and create a new deal with EOL for the partial volume\\nthey confirmed, as opposed to creating a new deal with a different\\ncounterparty.  Only one additional deal would have to be created with the\\nnext available counterparty to fill the last 5,000 of the original request.\\nSeems simply enough... and it would be in EOL's best interest to fill our\\ntransaction attempts partially so they would complete our transaction\\nattempts more often....   if they don't fill us partially, EOL will\\nprobably\\nend-up denying many of our transaction attempts if the exact volume is not\\navailable.  hmm.... what do ya'll think?\\n\\n-Stewart\\n\\nStewart D.

        "The model categorized all my messages as high priority, which I believe is not ideal. Ideally, I should receive at least one low-priority message. I can attribute this issue to the feature extraction process. When I fitted the training data to the extractor, it extracted 1,006 features, including vocabulary, dates, and more. However, my test messages may not contain all the vocabulary needed to account for these 1,006 features. Since the extractor remains the same (saved), any features not present in the message are recorded as 0. This leads to all my messages being categorized as high priority (0)."
